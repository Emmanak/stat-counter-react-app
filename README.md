# [Collaborative Stat Tracker (link)](https://stat-counter-react-app.web.app/)

This app was created to allow groups of people to gather stats collectively. 
It features customizable push-buttons that can be given their own name and color.
Everytime a button is pressed, it will increment the total value of that button by 1.
This change is synced across all devices. `DISCLAIMER`: Internet connection is required.
Buttons can also be deleted by any device. This feature will need to be used sparingly
when working in groups. It is advisable that the group is notified before a button is deleted.

## Using the app:
To access the app, First create and account using a valid email address. If the account is to
be shared with others, make your password accordingly. Passwords can be changed at anytime using
the ["Forgot Password?"]. 
Secondly, create buttons with names and colours of your preference. 
Finally, log into one or more devices to share button access. 

## Troubleshooting
Most problems can be fixed by simply pressing the "Refresh" button.
Occasionally, an error message or alert will notify you of any user input issues.

## Technical Information:
This app was created ReactJS using `create-react-app`.
The app is hosted on `Firebase`. All the authentication and database rules are handled by `Firestore`. 


## For information about using `create-react-app` read the notes below:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
